<h1>Hello!! </h1>

Hello! I am Takami. I studied Digital Design and Development at the British Columbia Institute of Technology. I enjoy creating projects, from designing to implementing, and sharing them with the world through social media. I am working towards expanding my knowledge to become a full-stack developer!
